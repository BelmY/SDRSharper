# SDRSharper Full Source (VS2017)
<h3>Build Order:</h3>
	Radio<br>
  Controls<br>
	PanView<br>
	Common<br>
	CollapsiblePanel<br>
	SDRSharper - Don't forget to check your references to the above.<br><br>
	NOTE: This solution will require Telerik RadForms. However, it can be easily converted back to winforms. Other changes made was converting 'int' to 'int32', a bug in the audiogram which caused crashing, and also updated to C#7/.NET 4.6. Solution with compile for both x32/x64bit builds. Nice!
